# data-mutations
*** The 'meat' of this package is in the mutator-resolver folder ***
- This repo is a work in progress to open source a utility that I use in personal projects on the back-end with sequelize
- The purpose of this package will be to add the ability to run data mutations on existing databases/tables before and after running a schema migration
